Title
BE PATIENT!
Matter
This is perhaps the most important tip for you: it doesn’t matter whether you want to gain or lose weight, you have to be patient.
Changes don’t happen overnight.

Title
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
Matter
To be able to eat as much as you want… that is all well and good. But you still need to eat a healthy diet if you want to gain weight fast.
Burgers, fries, and soft drinks are full of calories, but they also contain lots of saturated fats, salt, and sugar.
You are better off focusing on nutrient- and calorie-rich foods to gain weight.

Title
EAT REGULAR MEALS
Matter
You don’t have to eat your daily calorie requirement in three main meals.
Five or six regular meals (spaced out throughout the day) are easier on your stomach and keep you feeling full.
Plus, you should avoid skipping meals and you should always have some snacks on you in case you get hungry while on the go.

Title
GRADUALLY INCREASE PORTION SIZE
Matter
If you try to start eating enormous meals from one day to the next, it won’t work.
Gradually increase your portion size every week instead.
This way your body can get used to larger meals slowly.

Title
LIGHT PRODUCTS? NO THANKS!
Matter
Stay away from products labeled “low-fat” or “light”.
At the grocery store, make sure to buy the regular fat version.
Also, foods naturally high in fat like avocado, nuts, seeds or high-quality vegetable oil should be a regular part of your meal plan.
They fill you up and provide you with plenty of nutrients and calories.

Title
TRACK YOUR CALORIES
Matter
Log everything you eat and drink: a food tracking app helps you learn more about your eating habits.
Perhaps you can squeeze in a few more calories here or there? Or maybe you forgot to eat breakfast yesterday?

Title
RELY ON STRENGTH TRAINING
Matter
Exercise is very important for gaining weight. Intense bodyweight training, like with the adidas Training app, strengthens your muscles and also stokes your fat-burning engine.
Endurance sports like running or biking are also important for your health, but they burn a lot of calories without really stimulating muscle growth.
