Title
How to actually lose weight
Matter
People who have had success losing weight have a few things in common:
1.They weigh themselves at least once a week.
2.They restrict their calorie intake, stay away from high-fat foods, and watch their portion sizes.
3.They also exercise regularly. But note: They use physical activity in addition to calorie counting and other behavioral changes.

Title
Exercise and calories burn
Matter
Exercise accounts for a small portion of daily calorie burn.
Even when you work out, those extra calories burned only account for a tiny part of your total energy expenditure, only around 10 to 30 percent, depending on the person. It's not nearly equal to food intake.

Title
Eat varied, colorful, nutritionally dense foods.
Matter
Healthful meals and snacks should form the foundation of the human diet.
A simple way to create a meal plan is to make sure that each meal consists of 50 percent fruit and vegetables, 25 percent whole grains, and 25 percent protein.
Total fiber intake should be 25–30 grams (g) daily.

Title
Keep a food and weight diary
Matter
Self-monitoring is a critical factor in successfully losing weight.
Those who can track their success in small increments and identify physical changes are much more likely to stick to a weight loss regimen.

Title
Engage in regular physical activity and exercise
Matter
Regular exercise is vital for both physical and mental health.
Increasing the frequency of physical activity in a disciplined and purposeful way is often crucial for successful weight loss.
One hour of moderate-intensity activity per day, such as brisk walking, is ideal.

Title
Eliminate liquid calories
Matter
It is possible to consume hundreds of calories a day by drinking sugar-sweetened soda, tea, juice, or alcohol.
These are known as “empty calories” because they provide extra energy content without offering any nutritional benefits.
Unless a person is consuming a smoothie to replace a meal, they should aim to stick to water or unsweetened tea and coffee.

Title
Measure servings and control portions
Matter
Eating too much of any food, even low-calorie vegetables, can result in weight gain.
Therefore, people should avoid estimating a serving size or eating food directly from the packet.
It is better to use measuring cups and serving size guides.

Title
Stay positive
Matter
Weight loss is a gradual process, and a person may feel discouraged if the pounds do not drop off at quite the rate that they had anticipated.
Some days will be harder than others when sticking to a weight loss or maintenance program.
A successful weight-loss program requires the individual to persevere and not give up when self-change seems too difficult.
